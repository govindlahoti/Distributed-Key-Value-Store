Experimental Setup :

100 user send look up requests to random nodes continuously. We calculate the number of requests served by the system per second.
To simulate the practical behavior of time taken when reading from slow disc, we add a sleep time of 0.01 sec for each request at any node.

The experimental results are as follow:

Number of nodes | Number of requests per second
-----------------------------------------------
    1           |      94
    2           |      187
    4           |      322
